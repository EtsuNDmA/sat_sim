AstroSoftware.xlsx contain Cross-Reference of Available Functions [Excel spreadsheet]

Within each file there are specific routines to accomplish various operations. Effort has been taken to use similar names and function scopes, although there are some differences based on language features. The SOFTWARE worksheet discusses the specific routines that are available within each larger technical area.

The ALGORITHMS worksheet lists which routines are available (MATLAB).

The EXAMPLES worksheet lists what MATLAB scripts will perform the example exercises in the text. Many are complete, but a few remain to finish all the examples in the text.

The test program is a simple program that executes the input/output operations of each subroutine in that package. There isn't anything fancy about it. It's just intended to be a quick check of the answers. The TESTASTF.DAT file contains my results using the codes. Additional work is needed to update this file, but it’s a start.
